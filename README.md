# odin-recipes
A project built in HTML, which will contain recipes of multiple food items, connected by hyperlinks and decorated with images.

After successful completion of this project, I will have mastered the following skills :

    1. Creation of basic text in HTML

    2. Linking HTML documents with one another (Absolute and relative links)
    
    3. Usage of images in HTML webpages (Absolute links to images as well as relative images)

Constructive criticism is greatly appreciated in the aftermath of this project. Take a look!
